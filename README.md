Programming for Everybody (Getting Started with Python) UoM


# Welcome to Python 3
As of June 2017, the course is taught using Python 3. The Python community has been moving from Python 2 to Python 3 for a long time and we felt that it was time to convert our course. In a beginning course and this specialization, the differences between the two versions of Python are pretty minimal.

The print statement has become the print function. What this means is that this line in Python 2:



is as follows in Python 3:



The raw_input function has also changed to input, so instead of:



you will see:



The only other significant change is how Python handles various character sets like (次 - Tsugi) and (코스 - Koseu). You will learn more about this in the third and fourth classes in the specialization.

You might find that your job still wants to use Python 2. We believe that going from Python 3 to Python 2 is pretty easy - so don't worry too much about the version of Python that you learn when you are first starting out.

If you want to see the Python 2 materials and text book from the previous version of the course, an archive of that material continues to be available at http://www.pythonlearn.com/.

##Tools
1. https://atom.io/
2. TextWrangler/BBEdit on the Macintosh and NotePad++ on Windows
3. Python using the Anaconda distribution, also includes many science and data analysis libraries, there you can use the Spyder development environment to edit and run your Python programs
4. If you already use Eclipse for Java development, you might want to look at PyDev, a Python IDE that runs on top of Eclipse. or PyCharm like IDEs.
